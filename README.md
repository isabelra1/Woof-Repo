Comparing the genetic makeup of two dog breeds can provide valuable insights into the effects of breeding practices on genomic diversity and health. Using a reference genome from a Labraodor Retriever and comparing the partial sequencing of a Bulldog, I hope to use tools like GATK to indentify genomic regions where the two breeds differ. 

1) Use fasterq-dump to safely download the data
2) Use GATK to identify genomic variants
3) Interpret results
